## Prevening Plagiarism at PyCon-India

### Basic Rules

- Plagiarism is strictly discouraged
- Rules apply to content submitted for talks, workshops, posters - all things  published publicly at PyCon India.
- Organisers of PyCon India shall take appropriate steps to prevent plagiarised content, and to punish those submitting them. 

### Implementation

#### During the CFP

- A plagiarism check-list to be displayed before the content is submitted
  (by adding to the UI in Junction, for example).
- A software based plagiarism check to be run on all submitted proposals.
- Authors whose content is flagged as plagiarised should be informed and given a chance to explain (to eliminate chances of mistakes in software)
- Proposals with plagiarised content be rejected and deleted. Authors be served warning.

#### On selection

- All selected proposals be rechecked for palgiarism.
- Selected authors/speakers be re-informed about the policy
- Sponsored/invited/keynote speakers should also be made aware of the policy

#### After the conference

- When there is a complain after the conference, the CFP chair/workgroup should promptly respond, sharing details of the policy with the complainant (check policy-summary-complainant.md)
- The complainant is expected to provide evidence of plagiarism.
- If the evidence looks reasonable, the content should be temporarily removed from all the websites (CFP-site/main-website/archives etc).
- The author should be informed, and be given a chance to explain
- The CFP workgroup, along with the organisers should discuss and decide on the claim.

#### Decision-making guidelines

- If the content seems plagiarised beyond doubt, it should be permanently deleted 
- If the submitter seems wilful, s/he should be added to a ban list
- If the case seems only a level-3 (minor), s/he can be given a warning and left (Level details in section below)
- If the case seems complicated, expert legal opinion should be saught (eg - it involves interpretation of licences)

### Ban list

A banlist should be maintained, and the offenders should not be permitted to apply to any events related to PyCon India for a period of **three** years.

## Levels of Plagiarism

- Level-1: Extreme: The plagiarised content is greater than 50% of the overall content
- Level-2: Sizeable: The plagiarised content is between 10% and 50% of the overall content
- Level-3: Minor: The plagiarised content is less than 10% of the overall content


### Privacy

- The names and contact details of complainants shall be kept private and confidential at all times.
- The names and contact details of authors who get investigated shall also be kept private at all times (irreseptive of the decision)
- The ban list shall also be kept private.


## Open areas
