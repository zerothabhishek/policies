## Plagiarism checklist for authors

- Proposals are expected to be original content. Plagiarism is highly discouraged.
- While using/building on someone else's academic research give appropriate 
  credits.
- If the proposal is based on/uses open source code from someone else,
  make sure the license allows it.
- While using media content (pictures/videos) from the internet, make sure 
  copyright allows it. Don't use if the owner/copyright is unclear.
- While using content created by a colleague, do mention that you have 
  permissions to use it. Otherwise it will be considered plagiarised
